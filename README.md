# Project 1 Random Graphs and Random Walks (R)

- Part 1 Generating Random Networks
- Part 2 Random Walk on Networks

# Project 2 Analyzing Friendship Networks of Individuals to Identify Strong Social Ties (R)
In this project, we will study the various properties of social networks. In the first part of the project, we will study an undirected social net- work (Facebook). In the second part of the project, we will study a directed social network (Google +).

# Project 3 Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the task of learning from interaction to achieve a goal. The learner and the decision maker is called the agent. The thing it interacts with, comprising everything outside the agent, is called the en- vironment. These interact continually, the agent selecting actions and the environment responding to those actions by presenting rewards and new states.

In the first part of the project, we will learn the optimal policy of an agent navigating in a 2-D environment. We will implement the Value iteration algorithm to learn the optimal policy.

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is the task of extracting an expertâ€™s re- ward function by observing the optimal policy of the expert. In the second part of the project, we will explore the application of IRL in the context of apprenticeship learning.
